# OVERVIEW
BIDS HCP wraps all the major stages of processing outlined in the minimally processed pipeline.  
When beginning work with this gear, please take a close look at utils.set_gear_args.py to determine the structure of the inputs used throughout the remained of the package.  
Below, specific notes about processing each modality are listed.

# HCP STRUCT
[Flywheel Gear](https://github.com/flywheel-io/gears/tree/master/spec) that runs the structural preprocessing steps of the [Human Connectome Project](http://www.humanconnectome.org) Minimal Preprocessing Pipeline (MPP) described in [Glasser et al. 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23668970).  Currently, this includes v4.0.1 release of PreFreeSurfer, FreeSurfer, and PostFreeSurfer pipelines, as well as generating some helpful QC images. For more info on the pipelines, see [HCP Pipelines](https://github.com/Washington-University/Pipelines).

## Important notes
* T1w and T2w volumes should not have any online bias-correction (e.g.: no "Pre-scan Normalize" option on Siemens scanners). If on-scanner bias-correction was applied, it must be applied to **BOTH** T1w and T2w inputs.
* All MRI inputs (T1w, T2w, FieldMaps) must include BIDS-conformed DICOM metadata!
* Gradient nonlinearity correction (using coefficient file) is currently only available for data from Siemens scanners.
* Readout distortion correction using B0 field maps (Field map "Option 1", below) is currently only available for data from Siemens scanners.  "TOPUP"-style correction (Field map "Option 2", below) should work for all data (but has not yet been tested). GE field maps are not supported as the algorithms are unavailable from HCP at this time.

## Required inputs
1. T1-weighted anatomical volume (eg: MPRAGE), <= 1mm spatial resolution
2. T2-weighted anatomical volume (eg: SPACE, FLAIR), <= 1mm spatial resolution
3. FreeSurfer license.txt file  (found in `$FREESURFER_HOME/license.txt`)

## Optional inputs
1. Field map for correcting readout distortion ("avgrdcmethod_struct")
    * Option 1: "typical" GRE B0 field map including magnitude and phase volumes
    * Option 2: a pair of spin echo with opposite phase-encode directions ("Positive" = R>>L or P>>A, and "Negative" = L>>R or A>>P) for "TOPUP"-style distortion estimation
    * **Note 1**: If readout distortion correction is performed, user **must** specify the correct "unwarp_dir_struct" config option.  For HCP scans (sagittal slices with A>>P phase-encoding), this should be "z", corresponding to readout in the F>>H direction.
    * Note 2: This effect is very small, at most 0.35mm in a few high-susceptibility areas (e.g., orbitofrontal)
2. Gradient nonlinearity coefficients copied from scanner. See [FAQ 8. What is gradient nonlinearity correction?](https://github.com/Washington-University/Pipelines/wiki/FAQ#8-what-is-gradient-nonlinearity-correction)
    * If needed, this file can be obtained from the console at `C:\MedCom\MriSiteData\GradientCoil\coeff.grad` for Siemens scanners
    * Note: This effect is significant for HCP data collected on custom Siemens "ConnectomS" scanner, and for 7T scanners.  It is relatively minor for production 3T scanners (Siemens Trio, Prisma, etc.)

## Configuration options
1. Subject: Subject ID to use for outputs
2. reg_name: Surface registration type: either 'FS' (freesurfer) or 'MSMSulc' (HCP default). (See [FSL MSM](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MSM) for details on MSMSulc)
3. BrainSize: Brain size in mm (in Superior-Inferior axis), typically 150 (default) for adults
4. template_size: Voxel size of HCP anatomical template. Best if matches input. (Options = 0.7mm, 0.8mm (default), 1mm)
5. unwarp_dir_struct: Readout direction for structural scans ( 'x', 'x-', 'y', 'y-', 'z', 'z-' ). HCP default = 'z' (**Only used when providing fieldmaps to correct readout distortion**)

## Outputs
* `\<subject\>\_hcpstruct.zip`: Zipped output directory containing complete `MNINonLinear/`, `T1w/`, and `T2w/` folders.
* `\<subject\>\_hcpstruct\_QC.*.png`: QC images for visual inspection of output quality (details to come...)
* Logs (details to come...)


# HCP FUNC
[Flywheel Gear](https://github.com/flywheel-io/gears/tree/master/spec) that runs the functional preprocessing steps of the [Human Connectome Project](http://www.humanconnectome.org) Minimal Preprocessing Pipeline (MPP) described in [Glasser et al. 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23668970).  Currently, this includes v4.0-alpha release of fMRIVolume and fMRISurface, as well as generating some helpful QC images. For more info on the pipelines, see [HCP Pipelines](https://github.com/Washington-University/Pipelines).

## Important notes
* All MRI inputs (fMRI time series, FieldMaps) must include BIDS-conformed DICOM metadata!
* Gradient nonlinearity correction (using coefficient file) is currently only available for data from Siemens scanners.
* Readout distortion correction using B0 field maps (Field map "Option 1", below) is currently only available for data from Siemens scanners.  "TOPUP"-style correction (Field map "Option 2", below) should work for all data (but has not yet been tested).

## Required inputs
1. fMRI time series NiFTI
2. Field map for correcting readout distortion
    * Option 1: GRE = "typical" GRE B0 field map including magnitude and phase volumes
    * Option 2: SpinEchoFieldMap = a pair of spin echo with opposite phase-encode directions ("Positive" = R>>L or P>>A, and "Negative" = L>>R or A>>P) for "TOPUP"-style distortion estimation
3. StructZip output from the HCP-Struct gear (containing `T1w/`, `T2w/`, and `MNINonLinear/` folders)
4. FreeSurfer license.txt file  (found in `$FREESURFER_HOME/license.txt`)

## Optional inputs
1. fmri_scout: high-quality exemplar volume from fMRI time-series. If using Multi-Band for fMRI, and Single-Band reference volume is available, use SBRef. Otherwise, leave empty to first time series volume for registration.
2. Gradient nonlinearity coefficients copied from scanner. See [FAQ 8. What is gradient nonlinearity correction?](https://github.com/Washington-University/Pipelines/wiki/FAQ#8-what-is-gradient-nonlinearity-correction)
    * If needed, this file can be obtained from the console at `C:\MedCom\MriSiteData\GradientCoil\coeff.grad` for Siemens scanners
    * Note: This effect is significant for HCP data collected on custom Siemens "ConnectomS" scanner, and for 7T scanners.  It is relatively minor for production 3T scanners (Siemens Trio, Prisma, etc.)

## Configuration options
1. fMRIName: Output name for preprocessed data (default = rfMRI\_REST)
2. bias_correction_func: Bias-field estimation method. 'NONE' (default), 'SEBased', or 'Legacy'. 'SEBased'=Estimate from SpinEchoFieldMap (only possible with both Pos and Neg SpinEcho), 'Legacy'=Estimate from structural scans (only valid if structural collected in the same session, and without any subject movement)
3. mctype_func: Use 'MCFLIRT' (standard FSL moco) for most acquisitions.  'FLIRT'=custom algorithm used by HCP internally, but not recommended for public use
4. dof: Degrees of freedom for fMRI->Anat registration. 6 (default) = rigid body, when all data is from same scanner. 12 = full affine, recommended for 7T fMRI->3T anatomy
5. reg_name: Surface registration to use during CIFTI resampling: either 'FS' (freesurfer) or 'MSMSulc'. ('Empty'=gear uses reg_name from HCP-Structural)

# HCP DIFF
[Flywheel Gear](https://github.com/flywheel-io/gears/tree/master/spec) that runs the diffusion preprocessing steps of the [Human Connectome Project](http://www.humanconnectome.org) Minimal Preprocessing Pipeline (MPP) described in [Glasser et al. 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23668970).  This includes correction for EPI distortion (using [FSL topup](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/topup/TopupUsersGuide)), correction for motion and eddy-current distortion (using [FSL eddy](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/eddy)), and registration to subject anatomy. The *output of* this gear can serve as the *input* for diffusion modeling (eg: bedpostx) and tractography.
